    title: Projects
    intro: |
      Here's a list on some of the notable applications/libraries I was involved in.
    assignments:
      - title: Zendesk Salesforce Integration v2
        link: "https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360038232533-Setting-up-the-Zendesk-for-Salesforce-integration"
        tagline: |
          An integration used to sync tickets, contacts, and organizations between Zendesk and Salesforce.
          Developed using Go Lang and along side ZIS Services, a micro service for Zendesk integrations.

      - title: ZIS Transform
        # link: ""
        tagline: |
          One of the ZIS micro services with the purpose of declaratively transforming json objects into different forms.
          This service is usually called before the next task on the pipeline in order to adjust the payload to the correct format.

      - title: Zendesk Slack Integration
        link: "https://slack.com/apps/A9WFQ3M0B-zendesk"
        tagline: |
          Integration made with Go Lang that provides a way for customers to create Zendesk tickets on Slack and also subscribe to ticket events on selected Slack channels.
          It also has Zendesk Answer Bot support wherein a Slack user can ask questions and then the app will give Help Center article suggestions.

      - title: Zendesk Shopify Integration
        link: "https://apps.shopify.com/zendesk"
        tagline: |
          Integration with PHP middleware that automatically installs the Shopify App on Zendesk.
          The Shopify App made with React Redux then provides customer and previous orders information on the ticket sidebar.
          This is achieved by matching the email address of the Ticket requester and the Shopify customer.

      - title: Zendesk Chat Wordpress plugin
        link: "https://wordpress.org/plugins/zopim-live-chat/"
        tagline: |
          Plugin that automatically installs the Zendesk Chat widget on Wordpress pages.
          Not really part of the team that originally created it but I have experience maintaining it.

      - title: Yilinker
        tagline: "Ecommerce startup on the Philippines. Eventually closed because of rival companies dominating the market."
      
      - title: GoEvaluator
        link: "http://goevaluator.goabroad.com"
        tagline: |
          A tool for creating customizable review forms that travel providers can then send to travellers.
          Functionality is much like google forms but provides additional quirks that complements Goabroad.com.
          Spearheaded this project as an engineering R&D. At that time we wanted to experiment and update our tech stack.
          Part of which is to use Git instead of SVN, Angular, and Laravel instead of Symfony.
      
      - title: GoAbroad
        link: "https://www.goabroad.com"
        tagline: |
          Travel listing directory made using Symfony 1, JQuery, and Bootstrap.
